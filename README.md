# [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/) + [<img src="https://dagshub.com/img/favicon.svg" width=50 alt=""/>DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com) integration

This package allows you to output logs from `pytorch-lightning` runs to a simple, open format used by DAGsHub.

These logs include your metrics and hyperparameters, essential information to keep a record of your experiments.

## Usage
```bash
pip install pytorch-lightning-dagshub
```
```python
from pytorch_lightning_dagshub import DAGsHubLogger
from pytorch_lightning import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    logger=DAGsHubLogger(),
    default_save_path='lightning_logs',
)
```

By default, `DAGsHubLogger` will save the following two files:
* `lightning_logs/metrics.csv` - A CSV file containing all the run's metrics.
* `lightning_logs/params.yml` - A YAML file containing all the run's hyperparameters, plus an additional "status" field to
    indicate whether the run was successful.

## Examples

See examples in:
* [examples/hyperparams-as-dependency](examples/hyperparams-as-dependency/) <br/>
    Gives a framework for setting up your hyperparameter file as a [DVC](https://dvc.org) __dependency__ of the training stage. <br/>
    This means that you manually edit your [params.yml file](examples/hyperparams-as-dependency/params.yml) before training,
    then use [`dvc repro`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/repro) to run the training stage.
    This is the more theoretically correct way to use DVC. 
    
* [examples/hyperparams-as-output](examples/hyperparams-as-output/) <br/>
    Gives a framework for setting up your hyperparameter file as a [DVC](https://dvc.org) __output__ of the training stage. <br/>
    This means that you can keep using `pytorch-lightning` from the command line as usual, specifying hyperparameters as
    command arguments. <br/>
    After training is done and you're happy with the results, you can set the results in stone and make them reproducible
    using [`dvc commit`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/commit).
